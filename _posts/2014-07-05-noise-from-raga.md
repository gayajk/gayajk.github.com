I was trying to talk to you on whatsapp and then remembered that you are travelling so, i thought i would make you this blog, so that you can write about you awesome stuff without having to deal with all the software crap that goes into making a blog. I have tried to make it as simple as possible for you. You can obviously ping me if you have any questions.

To startwith, this is how you add an image.

**Make sure the image exists in the images directory. **

I know that just having images is not interesting enough, so lets add a video. All you need to do is copy a youtube link, and paste it in a line like the one below.

I think adding an image and a video are the two most essential things for any read-only blog. Incase you want to allow people to comment, let me know. I will do it on another day when i am waiting for you to reply to my message :p

What happens if you want to add a post and show it on your website ? <br>
Here are the steps --<br>
1) Copy and paste this file (the stuff in the start is quite important)<br>
2) Delete unwanted stuff<br>
3) replicate accordingly<br>
4) Make sure the name of the file is in the date-name.md format and the required images are in images/ directory and this file is in _posts/ directory.<br>
5) open the terminal app on your mac<br>
6) cd to the github repository (i will explain about cd and ls in the email i send you)<br>
7) do the following commands in the same order<br>
<br>
** git add * **<br>
** git add .* **<br>
** git add -u **<br>
** git commit -m "adding posts" **<br>
** git push **<br>

That's it, you can go to your website and see the new post. :)<br>
